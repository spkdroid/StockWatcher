## Configuration ⚙️

### API Key

This application uses the **Yahoo Finance API** for live data. You need an API key to fetch stock details.

1. Create a file `config.properties` in the `resources` directory:

   ```properties
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. Replace `your_api_key_here` with your Yahoo Finance API key.

### Local Stock Ticker Data

Stock ticker mapping is stored in `output.json` in the `resources` directory. Add or update the JSON file as needed.

Sample `output.json`:

```json
{
  "AAPL": "Apple Inc.",
  "GOOG": "Alphabet Inc.",
  "AMZN": "Amazon.com Inc."
}
```
